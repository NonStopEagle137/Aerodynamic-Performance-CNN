# Aerodynamic-Performance-CNN
This work aims to predict airfoil's performance characteristics from a binary image of an airfoil at a specific AoA. This implementation uses a rudimentary CNN that has about 700000 parameters.

# The Dataset
The dataset for this project is from 'ziliHarvey's' project. The '1_300.mat' file was used for training.

# Performance

The model was trained for 35 epochs and the Validation loss fell to 0.0037.

# Plots and Figures
